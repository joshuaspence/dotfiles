Version: v1.0.0

================================================================================
This repository contains various Unix configuration files that I use often. 
Anyone else is welcome to use these configuration files for their own personal 
use, but I take no responsibility or liability for any losses or damages 
incurred.

INSTRUCTIONS
~~~~~~~~~~~~
To install all configuration files, run the `install.sh' script in the root 
directory. Running the script with the `--all' flag will recurse through all 
subdirectories in the root directory and run the `install.sh' script in each of 
these directories. Any flags passed to the root `install.sh' script will be 
passed to the subdirectory `install.sh' scripts as well (except for the `--all' 
flag).

Note that some configuration files require root priveleges for installation. Use
the flags `--no-root' to not install these configuration files.

All configuration files will be symlinked to their destination directories. To 
copy the files instead, use the `--copy' flags.

TODO
~~~~
* Add arguments to root `install.sh' script such that the user can specify which
  subdirectories to install.
* Add a `--backup' and `--no-backup' flag to the `install.sh' scripts.
