This folder contains my configuration files for SSH.

The "~" subdirectory contains configuration files for the current user. The 
files in this subdirectory will be symlinked to the current user's home 
directory.

The "_" subdirectory contains global configuration files. Root access is usually
required to create the symlinks for these configuration files.

The "hosts" subdirectory contains public-private SSH key pairs.

To setup the symlinks, run the "install.sh" script.

Note that the files in this directory would not be useful for other people 
really.
