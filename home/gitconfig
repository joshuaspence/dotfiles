    ## If true, makes `git` convert CRLF at the end of lines in text files to LF
    ## when reading from the work tree, and convert in reverse when writing to

    ## conversion happens only while reading from the work tree but files are
    ## written out to the work tree with LF at the end of lines.
    autocrlf = input

    ## If true, makes `git` check if converting CRLF as controlled by
    ## `core.autocrlf` is reversible. `git` will verify if a command modifies a
    ## file in the work tree either directly or indirectly. For example,
    ## committing a file followed by checking out the same file should yield the
    ## original file in the work tree. If this is not the case for the current
    ## setting of `core.autocrlf`, git will reject the file. The variable can be
    ## set to "warn", in which case `git` will only warn about an irreversible
    ## conversion but continue the operation.
