    ## written out to the work tree with LF at the end of lines.

    ## If true, makes `git` check if converting CRLF as controlled by
    ## `core.autocrlf` is reversible. `git` will verify if a command modifies a
    ## file in the work tree either directly or indirectly. For example,
    ## committing a file followed by checking out the same file should yield the
    ## original file in the work tree. If this is not the case for the current
    ## setting of `core.autocrlf`, git will reject the file. The variable can be

    ## conversion but continue the operation.
