## Determine the amount of data that is represented by one line of dots when the
## progress style is "dot". "dot" is the default style when `wget` is run in the
## background (e.g. using `wget -b` or `nohup wget`). Based on the source code,
## these are the values:
##
## * default: 1 dot = 1 KiB,  1 cluster = 10 dots, 1 line = 5 clusters = 50 KiB
## * binary:  1 dot = 8 KiB,  1 cluster = 16 dots, 1 line = 3 clusters = 384 KiB
## * mega:    1 dot = 64 KiB, 1 cluster = 8 dots,  1 line = 6 clusters = 3 MiB
## * giga:    1 dot = 1 MiB,  1 cluster = 8 dots,  1 line = 4 clusters = 32 MiB
##
## Note that you can override this with the "dot_bytes", "dot_spacing" and
## "dots_in_line" settings.

## Follow FTP links from HTML documents by default.
follow_ftp = on

## Use UTF-8 as the default system encoding.
##
## WARNING: Makes `wget` builds that don't support this feature unusable. Does
## anyone know how to conditionally configure a `wget` setting?

## Do not go up in the directory structure when downloading recursively.
no_parent = on

## Lowering the maximum depth of the recursive retrieval is handy to prevent
## newbies from going too "deep" when they unwittingly start the recursive
## retrieval. The default is 5.

## Retry even when the connection was refused.

## Ignore `robots.txt` and `<meta name=robots content=nofollow>`.

## Print the HTTP and FTP server responses.

## Wait 60 seconds before timing out. This applies to all timeouts: DNS, connect
## and read. The default read timeout is 15 minutes.
timeout = 60

## Use the server-provided last modification date, if available.

## Retry a few times when a download fails. The default is 20.

## Use the last component of a redirection URL for the local file name.
