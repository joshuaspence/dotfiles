## Global @{{{
    Host *
        ## If this flag is set to "yes", `ssh` will additionally check the host
        ## IP address in the `~/.ssh/known_hosts` file. This allows `ssh` to
        ## detect if a host key changed due to DNS spoofing. If the option is
        ## set to "no", the check will not be executed.
        CheckHostIP yes

        ## Specifies whether to use compression.
        Compression no

        ## Enables the sharing of multiple sessions over a single network
        ## connection. When set to "yes", `ssh` will listen for connections on a
        ## control socket specified using the "ControlPath" argument. Additional
        ## sessions can connect to this socket using the same "ControlPath" with
        ## "ControlMaster" set to "no" (the default). These sessions will try to
        ## reuse the master instance's network connection rather than initiating
        ## new ones, but will fall back to connecting normally if the control
        ## socket does not exist, or is not listening.

        ## Specifies whether the connection to the authentication agent (if any)
        ## will be forwarded to the remote machine.
        ForwardAgent no

        ## over the secure channel and DISPLAY set.

        ## @link http://blogs.perl.org/users/smylers/2011/08/ssh-productivity-tips.html
        GSSAPIAuthentication no

        ## Specifies that `ssh` should only use the authentication identity
        ## files configured in the SSH config files, even if `ssh-agent` offers
        ## more identities. The argument to this keyword must be "yes" or "no".
        ## This option is intended for situations where `ssh-agent` offers many
        ## different identities.
        #IdentitiesOnly no

        ## Specifies a file from which the user's DSA, ECDSA or RSA
        ## authentication identity is read.
        IdentityFile ~/.ssh/%h

        ## This option disables host authentication for localhost.
        NoHostAuthenticationForLocalhost yes

        ## Specifies whether to use password authentication. The argument to
        ## this keyword must be "yes" or "no".
        PasswordAuthentication yes

        ## Allow local command execution via the "LocalCommand" option or using
        ## the `!command` escape sequence in `ssh`. The argument must be "yes"
        ## or "no".
        PermitLocalCommand no

        ## Specifies the protocol versions `ssh` should support in order of
        ## preference. The possible values are "1" and "2". Multiple versions
        ## must be comma-separated.
        Protocol 2

        ## Specifies whether to try public key authentication. The argument to
        ## this keyword must be "yes" or "no".

        ## If this flag is set to "yes", `ssh` will never automatically add host
        ## keys to the `~/.ssh/known_hosts` file, and refuses to connect to
        ## hosts whose host key has changed. This provides maximum protection
        ## against trojan horse attacks, though it can be annoying when the
        ## `/etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts` file is poorly maintained or when
        ## connections to new hosts are frequently made. This option forces the
        ## user to manually add all new hosts.
        ##
        ## If this flag is set to "no", `ssh` will automatically add new host
        ## keys to the user known hosts files.
        ##
        ## If this flag is set to "ask", new host keys will be added to the user
        ## known host files only after the user has confirmed that is what they
        ## really want to do, and `ssh` will refuse to connect to hosts whose
        ## host key has changed. The host keys of known hosts will be verified
        ## automatically in all cases.
        ##
        ## The argument must be "yes", "no" or "ask". The default is "ask".
        StrictHostKeyChecking ask

        ## Specifies whether to verify the remote key using DNS and SSHFP
        ## resource records.
        ##
        ## If this option is set to "yes", the client will implicitly trust keys
        ## that match a secure fingerprint from DNS. Insecure fingerprints will
        ## be handled as if this option was set to "ask".
        ##
        ## If this option is set to "ask", information on fingerprint match will
        ## be displayed, but the user will still need to confirm new host keys
        ## according to the "StrictHostKeyChecking" option.
        ##
        ## The argument must be "yes", "no" or "ask". The default is "no".
        VerifyHostKeyDNS ask

        ## If this flag is set to "yes", an ASCII art representation of the
        ## remote host key fingerprint is printed in addition to the hex
        ## fingerprint string at login and for unknown host keys.
