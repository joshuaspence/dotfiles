This folder contains configuration files for my GTK Bookmarks.

The "~" subdirectory contains configuration files for the current user. The 
files in this subdirectory will be symlinked to the current user's home 
directory.

The "_" subdirectory contains global configuration files. Root access is usually
required to create the symlinks for these configuration files.

To setup the symlinks, run the "install.sh" script.

Note that the files in this directory would not be useful for other people 
really.
