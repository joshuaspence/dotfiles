     SSH_ASKPASS           If ssh needs a passphrase, it will read the passphrase from the current terminal if it was run from a terminal.  If ssh
                           does not have a terminal associated with it but DISPLAY and SSH_ASKPASS are set, it will execute the program specified
                           by SSH_ASKPASS and open an X11 window to read the passphrase.  This is particularly useful when calling ssh from a
                           .xsession or related script.  (Note that on some machines it may be necessary to redirect the input from /dev/null to
                           make this work.)

     SSH_AUTH_SOCK         Identifies the path of a UNIX-domain socket used to communicate with the agent.

     SSH_CONNECTION        Identifies the client and server ends of the connection.  The variable contains four space-separated values: client IP
                           address, client port number, server IP address, and server port number.

     SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND  This variable contains the original command line if a forced command is executed.  It can be used to extract the origi‐
                           nal arguments.

     SSH_TTY               This is set to the name of the tty (path to the device) associated with the current shell or command.  If the current
                           session has no tty, this variable is not set.

     TZ                    This variable is set to indicate the present time zone if it was set when the daemon was started (i.e. the daemon passes
                           the value on to new connections).
